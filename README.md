# Dynamic Azure Data Factory Pipeline with CI/CD

[PDF Overview](https://github.com/halikowski/Azure-Rebrickable/blob/main/Azure_dynamic_pipeline_with_CICD.pdf)

The idea of this project originated from taking the course of Azure Data Engineer Associate certification on Microsoft Learning platform. As an addition to everyday learning, I decided to practice the skills and test features on my own in the Azure environment.

This project focuses on building a dynamic, scalable pipeline in Azure Data Factory together with the incorporation of CI/CD in Azure DevOps.
Data used in this project comes from the Rebrickable website (Rebrickable Website), which provides numerous files updated daily, ready for download, and also an API. Both names & number of files are customizable by JSON file in data lake. The same applies for the API files – for this purpose, two user accounts have been created to mimic a custom user-database, on base which we query data of user’s Lego sets, parts, etc.

Resources & features used in this project:
- Azure Data Factory
- Azure Databricks
- Azure Logic Apps
- Azure DevOps
- Other common resources like Data Lake
